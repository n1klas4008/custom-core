# custom-core

this repository serves as a standard library for most of my java related project
<hr>
the reason I write my own libraries is to get a better understanding on how things work rather than just importing something without knowing how it works

the code in this project will not be documented or commented for now
<hr>

if you have any questions regarding any of the standard libraries please open an issue
